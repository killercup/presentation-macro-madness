Just kidding!

This topic is _way_ too large for this short a talk

I just don't want to write the same code over and over again

. . .

I also like to make up abstract solution

This is a dangerous combinationâ€¦


# Case Study 1: A repetitive `impl`

# Case Study 2: A byte patter

# Case Study 3: This escalated quickly

# Thank you!

I'm Pascal and I want you to talk to me!
